When would you want to create a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to show off your code to the world, 
and to collab with other programmers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want the version thats currently up,
you might want a customizable personal working environment.
